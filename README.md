# FontManager.NET

The font parser is probably 85-90% complete.

I have started the FontExplorer project to test the font parser. The FontExplorer project is a simple WPF application that displays the font information in a visual format. It is helping me to visualize the font data and I hope might be a useful tool to others as well.
