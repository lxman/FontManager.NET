from: The Compact Font Format Specification (https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/offline/PostScript/5176.CFF.pdf)
....CFF
allows multiple fonts to be stored together in a unit called a FontSet.

Principal space  savings are  a result  of  using  a
compact binary  representation  for  most of  the information
sharing of   common data   between fonts, and
defaulting frequently occurring data.

The CFF format is designed to be used in conjunction with
Type 2 char strings for the character description procedures
(see Adobe Technical Note #5177: “The Type 2 Charstring
Format”).
